In a Hindi elocution competition, there are 30 prizes to be awarded, consisting only of 1st and 2nd prizes. The 1st prize is valued at ₹ 2,000 each and the 2nd prize is valued at ₹ 1,000 each. If the total prize money amounts to ₹ 51,000, then the steps to determine the number of 1st prizes and the number of 2nd prizes are as shown below.
Step 1: Let the 1st prizes be x in number and the number of 2nd prizes be (30 – x).
Step 2: (₹ 2000 × x) + [₹ 1000 × (30 – x)]  = ₹ 51,000     [Given]
                                    ₹ 1000 x + ₹ 30,000 = ₹ 51,000
Step 3: ₹ 1000 x = ₹ 51,000 – ₹ 30,000      [transposing ₹ 30,000 to RHS]       Or, ₹ 1000 x = ₹ 21,000
Step 5: The number of 1st prize = 𝑥 = 21 and the number of 2nd prize = 30 – 𝑥 = 30 – 21 = 9
Which of the given steps is correct to find the number of 1st prizes and the number of 2nd prizes?

In a Science quiz, 40 prizes consisting of only 1st and 2nd prizes are to be given. 1st and 2nd prizes are worth ₹ 3,000 and ₹ 1,500 respectively. If the total prize money is ₹ 96,000 then the steps to find out the number of 1st prizes and the number of 2nd prizes are as shown below.
Step 1: Let the 1st prizes be x in number and the number of 2nd prizes be (40 – x).
Step 2: (₹ 3000 × x) + [₹ 1500 × (40 – x)]  = ₹ 96,000     [Given]
                                    ₹ 1500 x + ₹ 60,000 = ₹ 96,000

In a Math Olympiad, 50 prizes consisting of only Gold and Silver medals are awarded. Gold medals are worth ₹ 5,000 each and Silver medals are worth ₹ 2,500 each. If the total prize money is ₹ 2,00,000, then the steps to find the number of Gold and Silver medals awarded are as shown below.
Step 1: Let the number of Gold medals be x and the number of Silver medals be (50 – x).
Step 2: (₹ 5000 × x) + [₹ 2500 × (50 – x)]  = ₹ 2,00,000     [Given]
                                 ₹ 5000 x + ₹ 1,25,000 = ₹ 2,00,000
Step 3: ₹ 5000 x = ₹ 2,00,000 – ₹ 1,25,000      [transposing ₹ 1,25,000 to RHS]       Or, ₹ 5000 x = ₹ 75,000
Step 5: The number of Gold medals = 𝑥 = 15 and the number of Silver medals = 50 – 𝑥 = 50 – 15 = 35
